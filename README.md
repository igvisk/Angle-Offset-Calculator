\## ✨ Features



\- Calculation of:

&nbsp; - the perpendicular side (opening) based on the given base and angle

&nbsp; - the hypotenuse (slanted side)

\- Graphical visualization of the triangle in \*\*Canvas\*\* with scaling

\- Ability to move the drawing with the mouse or scrollbars

\- Simple GUI built with Tkinter

\- Menu with keyboard shortcuts:

&nbsp; - \*\*Ctrl+N\*\* – new calculation

&nbsp; - \*\*Ctrl+Q\*\* – quit

&nbsp; - \*\*F1\*\* – application information

&nbsp; - \*\*Esc\*\* - quit app info window

\- \*About\* window with author and license details

\## 📐 Geometric Model



\- \*\*Inputs:\*\*

&nbsp; 1. Length of the base line (adjacent side)

&nbsp; 2. Angle of the slanted line (default value: 5°)



\- \*\*Outputs:\*\*

&nbsp; 1. Length of the perpendicular side (opening) – opposite side

&nbsp; 2. Length of the hypotenuse

&nbsp; 3. Graphical representation of the triangle in `Canvas`
